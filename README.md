While building my own academic website, I spent countless hours looking at other researchers' websites and learning from their designs. After finally getting mine to a place I was happy with, I thought it might be helpful to share my template with others who might be on the same journey.

This is a simple template built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4 that I use for my own website. It's designed to be easy to customize and includes sections for the things most academics need - publications, projects, and other work. If you're looking to create your own academic website, feel free to use this as a starting point and modify it to better suit your needs.
